Linear Models-linear correlation models and regression, how to apply inferential statistics to linear regression, and how to use linear algebra to express linear models.
# Inference for Linear Regression
# Core Competencies
- Objective 01 - Identify the Appropriate Hypotheses to Test for a Statistically Significant Association Between Two Quantitative Variable
- Objective 02 - Conduct and Interpret a t-test for the Slope Parameter and Make the Connection Between the t-test for a Population Mean and Slope Coefficient
- Objective 03 - Identify the Appropriate Parts of the Output of a Linear Regression Model and Use Them to Build a Confidence Interval for the Slope Term
- Objective 04 - Identify Violations of the Assumptions for Linear Regression and Articulate Why Correlation Does Not Imply Causation Inference for Linear Regression
